# DRAFT: Community Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for experienced and aspiring technologists, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. 

## Purpose

The purpose of our Community Code of Conduct is to ensure that all participants have the best possible experience, while fostering an open and welcoming environment.

To that end, the goals of the Community Code of Conduct are to: 

1. Specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk effectively, productively, and respectfully.
2. Provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.
3. Make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds.


## Scope

This Community Code of Conduct applies to:

1. Community online communication channels. Including, but not limited to: Slack/IRC channels, mailing lists, websites forums, and social media groups.
2. Community events. Including, but not limited to: meetups and workshops.
3. Contributions to community open source projects. Including, but not limited to: code, comments, commits, wiki edits, and issues.


## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Focusing on what is best for the community


Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Community Code of Conduct Working Group

The Community Code of Conduct Working Group is a group of people that are responsible for handling conduct-related issues. Their purpose is to de-escalate conflicts and try to resolve issues to the satisfaction of all parties. They are:

* Kevin Stock ([@kevinstock][kevinstock])


## Handling Issues

If you encounter a conduct-related issue, you should report it to the Working Group using the process described below.

1. Submit a [Code of Conduct Report][report]. Your message will reach the Working Group. If you do not feel comfortable contacting the group as a whole you may contact a member of the group directly. That member will then raise the issue with the Working Group as a whole, preserving the privacy of the reporter (if desired).
    * If your report concerns a member of the Working Group they will be recused from Working Group discussions of the report.
    * The Working Group will strive to handle reports with discretion and sensitivity, to protect the privacy of the involved parties, and to avoid conflicts of interest.
2. The Working Group will meet to review the incident and determine what happened. With the permission of person reporting the incident, the Working Group may reach out to other community members for more context.
3. The Working Group will reach a decision as to how to act. These may include:
    * A request for a private or public apology.
    * A private or public warning.
    * A permanent or temporary ban from some or all community events and spaces.
4. The Working Group will reach out to the original reporter to let them know the decision.
5. Appeals to the decision may be made to the Working Group, or to any of its members directly.

Note that the goal of the Code of Conduct and the Working Group is to resolve conflicts in the most harmonious way possible. We hope that in most cases issues may be resolved through polite discussion and mutual agreement. Bannings and other forceful measures are to be employed only as a last resort.
